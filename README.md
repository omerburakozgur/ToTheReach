# ToTheReach
My own made 2d platformer, side scroller, action-adventure game.

Made by Omer Burak Ozgur as a portfolio project for job applications in a span of 3-4 months, the game consists of mostly free assets and some changed/created assets by me. Main purpose of the project is to fill my portfolio as a newly graduated computer engineer and junior game developer, I might update the game to add mobile and controller support later. Feel free to contact me any time and give your feedback, opinion and job offer maybe :). Thanks for spending your time and playing my game.
